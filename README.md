This package provides an easy way to work with Varnish 4 (or 5) in Laravel. It provides a route middleware that, when applied to a route, will make sure Varnish will cache the response no matter what. The package also contains a function to flush the Varnish cache from within the application.

## Installation

We assume that you've already installed Varnish on your server. If not read [this blogpost](https://murze.be/2017/01/varnish-on-a-laravel-forge-server/) to learn how to install it.


You can install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require spatie/laravel-varnish
```

The package will automatically register itself.

Next you must publish the config-file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Varnish\VarnishServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

This is the contents of the published file:

```php
return [
    /*
     * The hostname(s) this Laravel app is listening to.
     */
    'host' => ['example.com'],

    /*
     * The execution type to be used. Allowed values are 'command' or 'socket'.
     *
     * This will determine whether `varnishadm` or the varnish administrative socket
     * is used for a local or remote varnish instance, respectively.
     */
    'execution_type' => 'command',

    /*
     * The location of the file containing the administrative password.
     */
    'administrative_secret_file' => '/etc/varnish/secret',

    /*
     * The actual administrative password used in your varnish configuration.
     *
     * When using `execution_type` 'command', use `administrative_secret_file`
     * instead, as `varnishadm` expects the secret to be a file path.
     *
     * If you are using `execution_type` 'socket', both parameters are supported, but
     * `administrative_secret` will take precedence over `administrative_secret_file`.
     */
    'administrative_secret' => '',

    /*
     * The host where the administrative tasks may be sent to when
     * using execution_type 'socket'.
     */
    'administrative_host' => '127.0.0.1',

    /*
     * The port where the administrative tasks may be sent to.
     */
    'administrative_port' => 6082,

    /*
     * The default amount of minutes that content rendered using the `CacheWithVarnish`
     * middleware should be cached.
     */
    'cache_time_in_minutes' => 60 * 24,

    /*
     * The name of the header that triggers Varnish to cache the response.
     */
    'cacheable_header_name' => 'X-Cacheable',
];
```

In the published `varnish.php` config file you should set the `host` key to the right value.
Also make sure that the `execution_type` is set to **socket** if you would like to use this command
to flush the cache of a remote Varnish server. Set `execution_type` to **command** to use `varnishadm`
on the local system.

In case you've set the `execution_type` to **socket**, you can either store the administrative secret
in a file and set `administrative_secret_file`, as used by `varnishadm`, or provide the actual
secret string in the `administrative_secret` variable.

Add the `Spatie\Varnish\Middleware\CacheWithVarnish` middleware to the route middelwares:

```php
// app/Http/Kernel.php

protected $routeMiddleware = [
...
   'cacheable' => \Spatie\Varnish\Middleware\CacheWithVarnish::class,
];
```

Finally, you should add these lines to the `vcl_backend_response` function in your VCL (by default this is located at `/etc/varnish/default.vcl` on your server):

```
if (beresp.http.X-Cacheable ~ "1") {
    unset beresp.http.set-cookie;
}
```

We highly recommend using the VCL provided [the varnish-5.0-configuration-templates repo](https://github.com/mattiasgeniar/varnish-5.0-configuration-templates) made by [Mattias Geniar](https://github.com/mattiasgeniar).

## Usage

### Caching responses

The routes whose response should be cached should use the `cacheable` middleware.

```php
// your routes file

//will be cached by Varnish
Route::group(['middleware' => 'cacheable'], function() {
    Route::get('/', 'HomeController@index');
    Route::get('/contact', 'ContactPageController@index');
});

//won't be cached by Varnish
Route::get('do-not-cache', 'AnotherController@index');
```

The amount of minutes that Varnish should cache this content can be configured in the `cache_time_in_minutes` key in the `laravel-varnish.php` config file. Alternatively you could also use a middleware parameter to specify that value.

```php

// Varnish will cache the responses of the routes inside the group for 15 minutes
Route::group(['middleware' => 'cacheable:15'], function() {
   ...
)};
```

Behind the scenes the middleware will add an `X-Cacheable` and `Cache-Control` to the response. Varnish will remove all cookies from Laravel's response. So keep in mind that, because the`laravel_session` cookie will be removed as well, sessions will not work on routes were the `CacheWithVarnish` middleware is applied.

### Clearing cache from Varnish

There's an artisan command to flush the cache. This can come in handy in your deployment script.

```bash
php artisan varnish:flush
```

If `execution_type` is set to **command**, under the hood flushing the cache will call the
`sudo varnishadm`. To make it work without any hassle make sure the command is run by
a unix user that has `sudo` rights.

You can also do this in your code to flush the cache:

```php
(new Spatie\Varnish\Varnish())->flush();
```
